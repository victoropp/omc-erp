## Integration Points

### Service Registration Pattern
All services should register themselves on startup:
```typescript
// Example service registration
const serviceInstance = {
  name: 'pricing-service',
  version: '1.0.0',
  host: 'localhost',
  port: 3006,
  type: 'api',
  healthEndpoint: '/health',
  tags: ['pricing', 'business-logic'],
  dependencies: ['postgres', 'redis']
};

await axios.post('http://service-registry:3010/registry/register', serviceInstance);
```

### Event Publishing Pattern
Services can publish events for system-wide communication:
```typescript
// Example event publishing
await eventBusService.publishEvent({
  type: EventType.PRICE_UPDATED,
  data: { stationId, newPrice, oldPrice },
  source: 'pricing-service',
  priority: EventPriority.NORMAL,
  tags: ['pricing', 'station-update']
});
```

### Centralized Logging Pattern
Services use the centralized logging system:
```typescript
// Example logging
await loggerService.logInfo('pricing-service', 'Price calculation completed', {
  stationId: 'STN001',
  calculationTime: 150,
  newPrice: 7.45
});
```

## Environment Variables

### Service Registry
```env
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
PORT=3010
NODE_ENV=development
```

### API Gateway
```env
SERVICE_REGISTRY_URL=http://service-registry:3010
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
PORT=3000
# Service URLs for fallback
AUTH_SERVICE_URL=http://auth-service:3001
PRICING_SERVICE_URL=http://pricing-service:3006
```

### Job Scheduler
```env
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
SERVICE_REGISTRY_URL=http://service-registry:3010
PORT=3013
```

## Docker Orchestration

The system is fully containerized with proper dependencies:

1. **Infrastructure**: PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, Kafka
2. **Orchestration**: Service Registry, API Gateway, Job Scheduler, Logging
3. **Business Services**: Auth, Pricing, Inventory, etc.

Start the entire system:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## API Endpoints

### Service Registry

- Discover Service: `GET /registry/discovery/{name}`
- Service List: `GET /registry/services`
- Service Health: `GET /registry/services/{id}/health`
- Service Metrics: `GET /registry/services/{id}/metrics`

### API Gateway
- All business endpoints: `/*` (proxied to services)
- Health Check: `GET /health`
- Metrics: `GET /metrics`

### Job Scheduler
- Add Job: `POST /jobs`

## Monitoring & Alerts

- Log cleanup: Every hour

### Alert Conditions

- High CPU/Memory usage (>90%)
- Low disk space (<5%)
- Database connectivity issues
- Critical business process failures

### Dashboard Metrics
- Total services registered
- Healthy/unhealthy service counts
- System resource utilization

2. **Horizontal Scaling**: Services can be replicated
3. **Queue Management**: Priority-based job processing
4. **Caching**: Redis-based response caching
5. **Event Streaming**: Asynchronous processing

## Development Workflow

1. **Service Development**: Implement business logic with health endpoints
