# OMC ERP System Architecture

## System Overview

The OMC ERP System is built using a **microservices architecture** designed specifically for Ghana Oil Marketing Companies. The system emphasizes scalability, maintainability, and regulatory compliance while providing enterprise-grade functionality.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Principles

### 1. Microservices Design
- **Service Independence**: Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Services are organized around business domains
- **API-First**: All inter-service communication through well-defined APIs
- **Data Ownership**: Each service owns its data and database

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Services communicate via events for loose coupling
- **Event Sourcing**: Critical business events are stored for audit and replay
- **CQRS Pattern**: Separate read and write operations for optimal performance

### 3. Scalability & Performance
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Auto-scaling based on load and demand
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching with Redis
- **Database Optimization**: Read replicas and connection pooling
- **Load Balancing**: Intelligent traffic distribution

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Design

### Database Per Service Pattern
Each microservice owns its database to ensure:
- **Data Isolation**: No direct database access between services
- **Technology Freedom**: Each service can choose optimal database technology
- **Independent Scaling**: Databases can be scaled independently
- **Failure Isolation**: Database failures don't cascade across services

### Shared Data Patterns
For data that needs to be accessed across services:
- **Event Publishing**: Services publish events when data changes
- **API Composition**: Services expose APIs for data access
- **CQRS Views**: Materialized views for complex queries

### Database Schema Examples

#### Chart of Accounts (Accounting Service)
```sql
CREATE TABLE chart_of_accounts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  tenant_id VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  account_code VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  account_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  account_type account_type_enum NOT NULL,
  ifrs_classification VARCHAR(50),
  parent_account_id UUID REFERENCES chart_of_accounts(id),
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### Employee Entity (HR Service)
```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  tenant_id VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  employee_number VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  ghana_card_number VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE,
  ssnit VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE,
  basic_salary DECIMAL(15,2),
  status employee_status_enum DEFAULT 'PROBATION',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## üîÑ Data Flow Architecture

### Synchronous Communication
```
Client Request ‚Üí API Gateway ‚Üí Service API ‚Üí Database
                                    ‚Üì
                              Response Data
```

### Asynchronous Communication
```

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Invalid input data",
    "details": [
      {
        "field": "amount",
        "message": "Must be greater than 0"
      }
    ],
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "requestId": "req_123456789"
  }
}
```

## üîê Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
```
1. User Login ‚Üí JWT Token (Access + Refresh)
2. API Request ‚Üí Token Validation ‚Üí Role/Permission Check
3. Service Communication ‚Üí Service-to-Service Authentication
```

### Multi-Tenant Security

);
```

## üìä Monitoring & Observability

### Application Metrics
```yaml
Performance Metrics:
  - API response times
  - Database query performance
  - Service availability
  - Error rates

Business Metrics:
  - Transaction volume
  - Revenue tracking
  - User activity
  - Compliance scores
```

### Logging Strategy
```yaml
Log Levels:
  - ERROR: System errors and exceptions
  - WARN: Performance issues and deprecations
  - INFO: Business events and workflows
  - DEBUG: Detailed execution traces

Log Format:
  timestamp: ISO 8601
  level: LOG_LEVEL
  service: service-name
  traceId: distributed-trace-id
  tenantId: tenant-identifier
  userId: user-identifier
  message: log-message
  metadata: additional-context
```

### Health Checks
```typescript
// Health check endpoint for each service
@Get('health')
async health(): Promise<HealthCheckResult> {
  return {
    status: 'healthy',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    uptime: process.uptime(),
    memoryUsage: process.memoryUsage(),
    databaseConnections: {
      primary: 'connected',
      replica: 'connected'
    },
    dependencies: {
      redis: 'connected',
      eventBus: 'connected'
    }
  };
}
```

## üöÄ Deployment Architecture

### Container Strategy
```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for optimal image size
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "run", "start:prod"]
```

### Environment Configuration
```yaml
Development:
  - Docker Compose for local development
  - Hot reload for rapid iteration
  - Mock external services

Staging:
  - Kubernetes cluster
  - Production-like data
  - Integration testing

Production:
  - Auto-scaling groups
  - Load balancers
  - Multi-AZ deployment
  - Backup and disaster recovery
```

## üìà Scalability Patterns

### Horizontal Scaling
```yaml
Auto-scaling Triggers:
  - CPU utilization > 70%
  - Memory utilization > 80%
  - Request queue depth > 100
  - Response time > 500ms

Scaling Limits:
  - Min instances: 2
  - Max instances: 20
  - Scale-up cooldown: 300s
  - Scale-down cooldown: 900s
```

### Caching Strategy
```yaml
L1 Cache: Application Memory
  - Frequently accessed reference data
  - TTL: 5 minutes

L2 Cache: Redis
  - Session data
  - Query results
  - TTL: 1 hour

L3 Cache: CDN
  - Static assets
  - API responses
  - TTL: 24 hours
```

### Database Optimization
```sql
-- Example: Optimized query with proper indexing
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_journal_entries_date_tenant
ON journal_entries (tenant_id, transaction_date);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_employees_status_tenant
ON employees (tenant_id, status) 
WHERE status = 'ACTIVE';
```

## üîÑ Data Consistency Patterns

### Eventually Consistent Operations
```typescript
// Example: Order processing with eventual consistency
async processPayrollCalculation(payrollData: PayrollData) {
  // 1. Calculate payroll (immediate)
  const payroll = await this.calculatePayroll(payrollData);
  
  // 2. Emit event for downstream processing (async)
  await this.eventBus.emit('payroll.calculated', {
    payrollId: payroll.id,
    employeeId: payroll.employeeId,
    amount: payroll.netPay
  });
  
  return payroll;
}
```

### Saga Pattern for Distributed Transactions
```typescript
class PayrollProcessingSaga {
  async execute(payrollData: PayrollData) {
    try {
      // Step 1: Calculate payroll
      const payroll = await this.payrollService.calculate(payrollData);
      
      // Step 2: Create journal entries
      const journalEntries = await this.accountingService.createEntries(payroll);
      
      // Step 3: Process payments
      const payment = await this.paymentService.processPayment(payroll);
      
      return { success: true, payroll, journalEntries, payment };
    } catch (error) {
      // Compensating actions for rollback
      await this.compensate(error);
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy
```yaml
Database Backups:
  - Full backup: Daily at 2 AM GMT
  - Incremental backup: Every 4 hours
  - Transaction log backup: Every 15 minutes
  - Retention: 30 days
  - Cross-region replication: Enabled

Application Data:
  - Configuration backups: Daily
  - File storage backup: Daily
  - Backup verification: Weekly
```

### Recovery Procedures
```yaml
RTO (Recovery Time Objective): 4 hours
RPO (Recovery Point Objective): 15 minutes

Recovery Steps:
  1. Declare disaster
  2. Activate DR site
  3. Restore database from backup
  4. Deploy application services
  5. Redirect traffic
  6. Validate system functionality
```

This architecture ensures the OMC ERP system is scalable, maintainable, secure, and compliant with Ghana's regulatory requirements while providing enterprise-grade functionality for oil marketing companies.
